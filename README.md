# Urgent-Process-Killer-Universal-
To use cd to the project in Terminal/Command Prompt/Powershell/Git bash/WSL and run it with python3 (if that doesn't work, try using python) then you can kill the process. note: ERRORS like sh: processkillername not found are normal, don't worry.
**Note: You need to have Python 3 or higher installed for this.**
